## Notes:
* This is currently a research project into next generation config management technologies!
* This is my first complex project in golang, please notify me of any issues.
* I have some well thought out designs for the future of this project, which I'll try and write up clearly and publish as soon as possible.
* Please don't expect stable interfaces, code, or any data safety.
* This design is the result of ideas I've had from hacking on advanced config management projects.
* I first started hacking on this in ~2013, even though I had very little time for it.
* I couldn't think of a good name for the project, so it's now being called `mgmt` until someone contributes a better one!
* I've published a number of articles about this tool:
  * TODO
* There are some screencasts available:

## Dependencies:
* golang (available in most distros)
